This protocol is of 3 wired SPI Protocol.
  Means the connection between Master and Slave is of 3 wires{Chip-Select(cs),Slave-Clock(sclk),Serial-Data-In-Out(sdio)}.
  Here,
       cs is Master's output and Slave input,
       sclk is Master generated clock to Slave input clock.
       sdio is inout port in both Master and Slave.
Note:-This code is not working properly i am working on it.
